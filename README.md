### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Feature-based organization**: Each feature (alumni, events, videos, etc.) has its own directory with components, hooks, and utilities
- **Route groups**: Next.js route groups `()` organize pages by access level without affecting URLs
- **API organization**: API routes grouped by access level for better security and organization
- **Shared resources**: Common components, hooks, and utilities in `shared/` directory
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all data models and components

### 🎥 Video Management System

- **YouTube Integration**: Seamlessly embed and manage YouTube videos
- **Role-based Access**: Control video visibility (public, user, admin)
- **Smart URL Parsing**: Automatically extract YouTube IDs from URLs
- **Preview System**: Instant video previews in admin interface
- **Search & Filtering**: Find videos by title, description, or tags
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized viewing experience on all devices
- **Dashboard Integration**: Manage videos alongside other content in admin tabs
